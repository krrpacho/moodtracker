# MoodTracker Web App

## Overview

The simplest mood-tracking web app that lets you:

- Choose an emoji each day to represent your mood.
- Write notes about each day.
- View, edit, and store these notes using local storage, keeping all your data saved in the browser.

This app uses a calendar to display daily moods, and by clicking on any emoji, you can view or edit the note written for that day.

To get started:

Install dependencies by running:
### `npm install`

Navigate to the project folder:
